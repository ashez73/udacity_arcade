GAME RULES

To win you must avoid collisions with bugs that will spawn on the left side of the playing area. Three bugs will keep spawning randomly in 3 different lines. When contacted with a bug a player will lose one courage - which serves as indication of remaining attempts and will be moved back to starting position. Player will also spawn a poo that serves only cosmetic purpose and will be pushed back to starting position. When the players' courage drops to zero the game is lost. Upon reaching the water row the player achieves victory.
